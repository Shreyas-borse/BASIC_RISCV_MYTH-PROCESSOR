# BASIC_RISCV_MYTH-PROCESSOR
VSD self guided RISCV processor design through the use of TL-Verilog and Makerchip

Final code -- ./Day_5/[riscv-pipeline-processorTL.v](https://github.com/Shreyas-borse/BASIC_RISCV_MYTH-PROCESSOR/blob/main/Day_5/riscv-pipeline-processorTL.v)
and ./Day3_5/[risc-v_solutions.tlv](https://github.com/Shreyas-borse/BASIC_RISCV_MYTH-PROCESSOR/blob/main/Day3_5/risc-v_solutions.tlv)

TL Verilog is beneficial in terms of Timing abstract, visuallizing and implementing sequential logic design based with cycle accuracy and cycle immaginations.
